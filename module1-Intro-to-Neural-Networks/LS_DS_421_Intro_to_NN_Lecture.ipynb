    "Neural Networks are a whole new area of study and application that can be intimidating, but which represents some of the most powerful tools and techniques that we possess in machine learning today. In spite of the hype surrounding these topics I hope that you will come to see them as just another tool in your tool bag with their own strengths and weaknesses. They are useful, but they are not a silver bullet, and they are not always preferable to other -perhaps more simple- machine learning methods. \n",

This week will not be a run-through of the history of Neural Networks and each of the individual advancements leading up to current technologies -we don't have time for that. We will spend some time on some older methods, but only to the degree that they will help introduce us to relevant terminology and understand more complex versions of these technologies."

    "\n",
    "Neural Networks aren't exactly a new technology, but recent breakthroughs have revitalized the area. The idea using math to represent the brain has been around since 1943, and the \"Perceptron\" - one of the basic building blocks of the technology- was invented in 1958. \n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Neural Networks are a computational model that was inspired by how neural networks in the brain process information. In the brain electrochemical signals flow from earlier neurons through the dendrites of the cell toward the cell body. If the received signals surpass a certain threshold with a given timing then the neuron fires sending a large spike of energy down the axon and through the axon terminals to other neurons down the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Wikipedia Neuron Diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Neuron.svg/500px-Neuron.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Artificial Neural Networks the neurons or \"nodes\" are similar in that they receive inputs and pass on their signal to the next layer of nodes if a certain threshold is reached, but that's about where the similarities end. Remember that ANNs are not brains. Don't fall into the common trap of assuming that if an Artificial Neural Network has as many nodes as the human brain that it will be just as powerful or just as capable. The goal with ANNs is not to create a realistic model of the brain but to craft robust algorithms and data structures that can model the complex relationships found in data."

Sometimes it is called the visible layer because it's the only part that is exposed to our data and that our data interacts with directly. Typically node maps are drawn with one input node for each of the different inputs/features/columns of our dataset that will be passed to the network.\n",

They're inside of the network and they perform their functions, but we don't directly interact with them. The simplest possible network is to have a single neuron in the hidden layer that just outputs the value. \"Deep Learning\" apart from being a big buzzword simply means that we are using a Neural Network that has multiple hidden layers. \"Deep Learning\" is a big part of the renewed hype around ANNs because it allows networks that are structured in specific ways to accomplish tasks that were previously out of reach (image recognition for example).  \n",

Typically the output value is modified by an \"activation function\" to transform it into a format that makes sense for our context, here's a couple of examples:\n",

Outputs in this case would represent the probability of predicting the primary class of interest. We can turn this into a class-specific prediction by rounding the outputted sigmoid probability up to 1 or down to 0. \n",

    "- NNS applied to multiclass classification problems might have multiple output nodes in the output layer, one for each class that we're trying to predict. This output layer would probably employ what's called a \"softmax function\" for accomplishing this. Don't worry about how that activation function works just yet, we'll get to it soon.\n"

    "Now, we didn't fit this line using any regression techniques so it's likely that it's **not** the line of best fit. But we could try out other lines and see if the error gets bigger or smaller. Well it just so happens that in this two dimensional world that if our line is stuck to the origin on one end then we don't have all of the freedom that we want to control our predictions. We need some way to slide it up and down the y axis so that we can make any line that we want in this two-dimensional world. This y-intercept is a constant value, or in other words it's always weighted by 1. We're going to call this y-intercept our \"bias\" term. We'll define this a little bit better in a minute. \n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "The first and simplest kind of neural network that we could talk about is the perceptron. A perceptron is just a single node or neuron of a neural network with nothing else. It can take any number of inputs and spit out an output. What a neuron does is it takes each of the input values, multiplies each of them by a weight, sums all of these products up, and then passes the sum through what is called an \"activation function\" the result of which is the final value.\n",
    "\n",
    "I really like figure 2.1 found in this [pdf](http://www.uta.fi/sis/tie/neuro/index/Neurocomputing2.pdf) even though it doesn't have bias term represented there.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to write what is happening in some verbose mathematical notation, it might look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    " y = sigmoid(\\sum(weight_{1}input_{1} + weight_{2}input_{2} + weight_{3}input_{3}) + bias)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding what happens with a single neuron is important because this is the same pattern that will take place for all of our networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "When imagining a neural network I like to think about the arrows as representing the weights, like a wire that has a certain amount of resistance and only lets a certain amount of current through. And I like to think about the node itself as containing the prescribed activation function that neuron will use to decide how much signal to pass onto the next layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activation Functions (transfer functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Neural Networks, each node has an activation function. Each node in a given layer typically has the same activation function. These activation functions are the biggest piece of neural networks that have been inspired by actual biology. The activation function decides whether a cell \"fires\" or not. Sometimes it is said that the cell is \"activated\" or not. In Artificial Neural Networks activation functions decide how much signal to pass onto the next layer. This is why they are sometimes referred to as transfer functions because they determine how much signal is transferred to the next layer.\n",
